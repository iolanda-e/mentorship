Each method supports optional start and end arguments. These arguments mean
that the action of the method is restricted to the portion of the target string starting
with the character at index start and up to but not including the character at index end.
If start is specified but end isnâ€™t,
then the method applies to the portion of
the target string from start through the end of the string.
